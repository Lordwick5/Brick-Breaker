# Brick-Breaker

This is a Java project which I created for my 3rd semester. 

•	The game launches in a window with bricks rendered in a grid layout. <br>
•	Player can move the paddle left and right using keyboard arrows.<br>
•	Ball bounces realistically off walls, paddle, and bricks.<br>
•	Bricks disappear upon collision with ball.
